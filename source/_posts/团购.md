"This article explores the concept of group buying (团购), a popular purchasing model that allows consumers to enjoy discounted prices by buying in bulk or as part of a group. The rise of e-commerce platforms and social media has contributed to the growth of group buying, benefitting both consumers and businesses."

"Group buying, also known as 团购 in Chinese, is a popular purchasing model that allows consumers to enjoy discounted prices by buying in bulk or as part of a group. This concept has gained significant traction in recent years, especially with the rise of e-commerce platforms and social media. Companies leverage group buying to attract more customers, increase sales volume, and create a sense of community among shoppers. Group buying deals typically involve a minimum number of participants to unlock the discounted price, encouraging individuals to share the opportunity with their friends and family. This collective purchasing power not only benefits the consumers but also helps businesses move inventory faster and reach a wider audience. With the convenience of online platforms, consumers can easily browse through a variety of group buying offers and select the ones that best suit their needs and preferences."

"In conclusion, group buying has revolutionized the way consumers shop and businesses sell products or services. By taking advantage of collective purchasing power, individuals can access exclusive discounts and deals while companies can boost sales and customer engagement. As the e-commerce landscape continues to evolve, group buying is expected to remain a prominent trend in the retail industry, offering mutual benefits for all parties involved."
