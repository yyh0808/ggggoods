It is common for parents to spend a considerable amount of time and effort in selecting a name, believing that a well-chosen name can bring good luck and blessings to the child throughout their life. Additionally, names are also crucial in professional and social settings as they can convey status, personality traits, and professional values."

By delving into the traditions and symbolism associated with naming, we gain a better understanding of the rich cultural heritage that values meanings and intentions behind names. Whether it be for a child, a business, or any endeavor, the act of choosing a name in Chinese culture is a deliberate and significant process that reflects the beliefs and hopes of individuals and families."
